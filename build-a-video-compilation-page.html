                The show is inspired by the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in "Gokuldham Co-operative Society" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. 'Taarak Mehta' is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his idea of controlling Tapu, but instead, the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to trouble Jethalal even more.
